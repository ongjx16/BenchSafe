BenchSafe was built as part of the RE2012 Renaissance Engineering Design Module in Nanyang Technological University.

## About

### Problem

Conventional Bench Press machines do not help to align the Exercise Bench with the Smith Machine. This results in a poor alignment of the user with the bar, which causes the following issues:

1. Injuries- 46% of powerlifting injuries are related to the bench press
2. Expensive- Hiring a personal fitness trainer to ensure proper form is not cheap
3. Inconvenient- It can be a hassle to repeatedly adjust the bench placement to ensure optimal alignment 

### Solution

An IoT solution to optimise the exercise bench position for gym users

### benchsafeweb
A Next.js webapp integrated with TensorFlow.js (Posenet) to get necessary body and bench measurements to provide the most accurate bench positions for every gym user

### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Next.js
4. Tensorflow
5. Firebase
6. Flask
